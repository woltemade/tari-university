<p>From <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a></u></p>
<p>Cryptography or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, kryptós &quot;hidden, secret&quot;; and γράφειν graphein, &quot;to write&quot;, or -λογία -logia, &quot;study&quot;, respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography.</p>
<p>From <u><a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/cryptography"><strong>SearchSecurity</strong></a></u></p>
<p>Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. The pre-fix &quot;crypt&quot; means &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;vault&quot; and the suffix &quot;graphy&quot; stands for &quot;writing.&quot;</p>

<a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction"><h1>Introduction</h1></a>
<p>This is an interactive introduction to digital signatures. It uses Rust code to demonstrate some of
the idea presented here, so you can see them at work. The code for this introduction makes use
of the <a href="https://github.com/tari-labs/libsecp256k1">libsecp256k-rs</a> library.</p>
<p>That's a mouthful, but secp256k1 is the name of the elliptic curve that secures a <em>lot</em> of things Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies' transactions.</p>
<p>This particular library has some nice features. I've overridden the <code>+</code> (addition) and <code>*</code> (multiplication)
operators so that the Rust code looks a lot more like mathematical formulae. This makes it much easier
to play with the ideas we'll be exploring.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> <em>Don't use this library in production code</em>. It hasn't been battle-hardened, so <a href="https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1">use this one in
production instead</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#lets-get-started" id="lets-get-started"><h1>Let's get started</h1></a>
<p>I'm going to assume you know the basics of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). If not, don't stress, there's a
<a href="https://gitpitch.com/tari-labs/tari-university/master?p=/cryptography/crypto-1#/">gentle introduction</a>
on Tari Labs University archives.</p>
<a class="header" href="#public-and-private-keys" id="public-and-private-keys"><h2>Public and Private keys</h2></a>
<p>The first thing we'll do is create a public and private key.</p>
<p>On secp256k1, a private key is simply a scalar integer value between 0 and ~2<sup>256</sup>. That's roughly how many
atoms there are in the universe, so we have a big sandbox to play in.</p>
<p>We have a special point on the secp256k1 curve called <em>G</em>, that acts as the 'origin'. A public key is calculated
from the private key by multiplying it by <em>G</em>:</p>
<p>Let's take an example from <a href="https://chuckbatson.wordpress.com/2014/11/26/secp256k1-test-vectors/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>\[
P_a = k_a G
\]</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">extern crate libsecp256k1_rs;

<a class="header" href="#creating-a-signature" id="creating-a-signature"><h1>Creating a signature</h1></a>
<p>ECC math multiplication cannot be undone easily. This fact is used to create digital signatures. A valid digital signature is
a <em>proof</em> that the person providing the signature knows the private key corresponding to the public key the message
is associated with.</p>
<p>The approach to creating signatures always follows this recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a secret once-off number, <em>r</em></li>
<li>Create a public key, <em>R</em> from <em>r</em> (<em>R = r.G</em>)</li>
<li>Send the following to Bob, your recipient: your message (<em>m</em>), <em>R</em>, and your public key (<em>P = k.G</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The actual signature is created by hashing the combination of all the public information above to create a <em>challenge</em>, e:</p>
<p>\[
e = H(R || P || m)
\]</p>
<p>The hashing function is chosen so that <em>e</em> has the same range as your private keys. In our case, SHA256 is a good choice.</p>
<p>Now the signature is constructed using your private information:</p>
<p>\[
s = r + ke
\]</p>
<p>Now Bob can also calculate <em>e</em>, since he already knows <em>m, R, P</em>. But he doesn't know your private key, or nonce.
<em>Note:</em> When you construct the signature like this, it's known as a <em>Schnorr signature</em>, which we'll discuss in more
detail in the next section. There are other ways of constructing <em>s</em>, such as ECDSA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm" title="Wikipedia: ECDSA">WP1</a>, which is used in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But see this:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
sG &amp;= (r + ke)G \\
sG &amp;= rG + (kG)e \\
sG &amp;= R + Pe
\end{align}
\]</p>
<p>So Bob, must just calculate the Public key corresponding to the signature and check that it equals the RHS of the last
equation above (R + Pe), all of which Bob knows.</p>
<a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-the-nonce" id="why-do-we-need-the-nonce"><h2>Why do we need the nonce?</h2></a>
<p>Why do we need a nonce in the standard signature?</p>
<p>Let's say we naïvely sign a message m with</p>
<p>\[
e = H(R || m)
\]</p>
<p>and then the signature would be \(s = ek \).</p>
<p>Now as before, we can check that the signature is valid:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
s &amp;= ek \\
\therefore sG &amp;= (ek)G = e(kG) = eP
\end{align}
\]</p>
<p>So far so good. But anyone can read your private key now because s is a scalar, so \(k = e/s\)
is not hard to do.
With the nonce you have to solve \( k = (s - r)/e \), but r is unknown</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">extern crate libsecp256k1_rs as secp256k1;

use secp256k1::{SecretKey, PublicKey, thread_rng, Message};
use secp256k1::schnorr::{ Challenge};

#[allow(non_snake_case)]
fn main() {
    // Create a random private key
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let k = SecretKey::random(&amp;mut rng);
    println!(&quot;My private key: {}&quot;, k);
    let P = PublicKey::from_secret_key(&amp;k);
    let m = Message::hash(b&quot;Meet me at 12&quot;).unwrap();
    // Challenge, e = H(P || m)
    let e = Challenge::new(&amp;[&amp;P, &amp;m]).as_scalar().unwrap();

    // Signature
    let s = e * k;

    // Verify the signature

    println!(&quot;Signature is valid!&quot;);
    // But let's try calculate the private key from known information

<a class="header" href="#schnorr-signatures" id="schnorr-signatures"><h1>Schnorr signatures</h1></a>
<p>If you follow the crypto news, you'll know that that new hotness in Bitcoin is Schnorr Signatures.</p>
<p><img src="./img/schnorr-meme.jpg" alt="schnorr" /></p>
<p>But in actual fact, they're old news! The Schnorr signature is considered the simplest digital signature scheme
to be provably secure in a random oracle model. It is efficient and generates short signatures.
It was covered by U.S. Patent 4,995,082 which expired in February 2008 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature" title="Wikipedia:Schnorr signature">WP1</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#so-why-all-the-fuss" id="so-why-all-the-fuss"><h2>So why all the fuss?</h2></a>
<p>What makes Schnorr signatures to interesting (and potentially dangerous) is their simplicity.
Schnorr signatures are <em>linear</em>, so you have some nice properties.</p>
<p>Given two private keys <em>x, y</em> with corresponding public keys, <em>X, Y</em>, the following holds:</p>
<p>\[
(x + y)G = xG + yG = X + Y
\]</p>
<p>You saw this multiplicative property in the previous section, when we were verifying the signature. It's this
linear property of Schnorr signatures that makes it very attractive for things like</p>
<ul>
<li>signature aggregation</li>
<li>atomic swaps</li>
<li>'scriptless' scripts</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#naïve-signature-aggregation" id="naïve-signature-aggregation"><h1>(Naïve) Signature aggregation</h1></a>
<p>Let's see how the linearity property of Schnorr signatures can be used to construct a 2-of-2 multi-signature.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob want to co-sign something (a Tari transaction, say) without having to trust each other;
i.e. they need to be able to prove ownership of their respective keys, and the aggregate signature is
only valid if <em>both</em> Alice and Bob provide their part of the signature.</p>
<p>Assuming private keys are denoted \( k_i \) and public keys \( P_i \). If we ask Alice and Bob to each
supply a nonce, we can try</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
P_{agg} &amp;= P_a + P_b \\
e &amp;= H(R_a || R_b || P_a || P_b || m) \\
s_{agg} &amp;= r_a + r_b + (k_a + k_b)e \\
&amp;= (r_a + k_ae) + (r_b + k_ae) \\
&amp;= s_a + s_b
\end{align}
\]</p>
<p>So it looks like Alice and Bob can supply their own <em>R</em>, and anyone can construct the 2-of-2 signature
from the sum of the _R_s and public keys. This does work:</p>

<p>But this scheme is not secure!</p>
<a class="header" href="#key-cancellation-attack" id="key-cancellation-attack"><h1>Key cancellation attack</h1></a>
<p>Let's take the previous scenario again, but this time, Bob knows Alice's public key and nonce ahead of time, by
waiting until she reveals them.</p>
<p>Now Bob lies, and says that his public key is \( P_b' = P_b - P_a \) and public nonce is \( R_b' = R_b - R_a \).</p>
<p>Note that Bob doesn't know the private keys for these faked values, but that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Everyone assumes that \(s_{agg} = R_a + R_b' + e(P_a + P_b') \) as per the aggregation scheme.</p>
<p>But Bob can create this signature himself:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align}
s_{agg}G &amp;= R_a + R_b' + e(P_a + P_b') \\
&amp;= R_a + (R_b - R_a) + e(P_a + P_b - P_a) \\

<p>Scriptless Scripts are a means to execute smart contracts off-chain, through the use of Schnorr signatures. <a href="https://medium.com/blockchain-capital/crypto-innovation-spotlight-2-scriptless-scripts-306c4eb6b3a8">[1]</a></p>
<p>The concept of Scriptless Scripts was borne from Mimblewimble, which is a block chain design that with the exception of kernels and their signatures does not store permanent data. \( \eta=\gamma \) Fundamental properties of Mimblewimble include both privacy and scaling both of which require the implementation of Scriptless Scripts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovCBT1gyk9c&amp;t=0s">[2]</a></p>
<p>A brief introduction is also given in <a href="../../layer2scaling/more-landscape/landscape-update.html#a5-scriptless-scripts">#5 Scriptless scripts, Layer 2 Scaling Survey (part 2)</a></p>
<hr />
<a class="header" href="#the-benefit-of-scriptless-scripts" id="the-benefit-of-scriptless-scripts"><h2>The Benefit of Scriptless Scripts</h2></a>
<p>The benefit of Scriptless Scripts are functionality, privacy and efficiency.</p>
<p>With regards to functionality, Scriptless Scripts are said to increase the range and complexity of smart contracts. Currently, as within Bitcoin Script limitations stem from the number of <code>OP_CODES</code> that have been enabled by the network. Scriptless scripts move the specification and execution of smart contractions from the network to a discussion that only involves the participants of the smart contract.</p>
<p>With regards to privacy, moving the specification and execution of smart contracts from on-chain to off-chain increases privacy. When on-chain, many details of the smart contract are shared to the entire network including the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred. By moving smart contracts off-chain, the network only knows that the participants agree that the terms of their contract have been satisfied and that the transaction in question is valid.</p>
<p>With regards to efficiency, Scriptless Scripts minimize the amount of data that requires verification and storage on-chain. By moving smart contracts off-chain, there are less overheads for full nodes and lower transaction fees for users. <a href="https://medium.com/blockchain-capital/crypto-innovation-spotlight-2-scriptless-scripts-306c4eb6b3a8">[1]</a></p>

<a class="header" href="#a-list-of-scriptless-scripts" id="a-list-of-scriptless-scripts"><h2>A list of Scriptless Scripts</h2></a>

</ul>
<hr />
<a class="header" href="#the-role-of-schnorr-signatures" id="the-role-of-schnorr-signatures"><h2>The Role of Schnorr Signatures</h2></a>
<p>To begin with, the fundamentals of Schnorr signatures must be defined . The signer has a private key <em>x</em>, random nonce <em>r</em>, and <em>G</em> is the generator of a discreet log hard group. <em>P</em> is the public key. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mVOq1jaR1U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39m20">[4]</a></p>
<p>s, the signature, can then be computed as a simple linear transaction</p>
<p>$$
s=r+ex
$$</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>$$
e=H(P||r||message)
$$</p>
<p>$$
P=xG
$$</p>
<p>The position on the line chosen is taken as the hash of all the data that one needs to commit to, the digital signature. The verification equation involves the multiplication of each of the terms in the equation by G and takes in account the cryptographic assumption (discrete log) where G can be multiplied in but not divided out, thus preventing deciphering.</p>
<p>$$
sG=rG+exG
$$</p>
<p>ECDSA signatures (used in Bitcoin) are not linear in <em>x</em> and <em>r</em>, and thus less useful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovCBT1gyk9c&amp;t=0s">[2]</a></p>
<hr />
<a class="header" href="#schnorr-multi-signatures" id="schnorr-multi-signatures"><h2>Schnorr multi-signatures</h2></a>
<p>First, a mulit-signature (mulitsig) has multiple participants that produce a signature. Every participant might product a separate signature and concatenate them forming a mulitsig.</p>
<p>With Schnorr Signatures, one can have a single public key, which is the sum of many different people's public keys. the resulting key is one that signatures will be verifiable against. <a href="https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr/">[5]</a></p>
<p>The formulation of a mulitsig involves taking the sum of all components; thus all nonces and <em>s</em> values result in the formulation of a mulitsig. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mVOq1jaR1U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39m20">[4]</a></p>
<p>$$
s=Σs(i)
$$</p>
<p>It can therefore be seen that these signatures are essentially scriptless scripts. Independent public keys of several participants are joint to form a single key and signature, which when published do not divulge the details as to the number of participants involved or the original public keys.</p>
<hr />
<a class="header" href="#adaptor-signatures" id="adaptor-signatures"><h2>Adaptor Signatures</h2></a>
<p>This mulitsig protocol can be modified to produce an adaptor signature, which serves as the building block for all scriptless script functions. <a href="https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr/">[5]</a></p>
<p>Instead of functioning as full valid signature on a message with a key, an adaptor signature is a promise that a signature agreed to be published, will reveal a secret.</p>
<p>This concept is similar to that of atomic swaps, however no scrips are implemented. Since this is elliptic curve cryptography, there is only scalar multiplication of elliptic curve points. Fortunately, like a hash function, elliptic curve function in one way, so an elliptic curve point (<em>T</em>), can simply be shared and the secret will be it's corresponding private key.</p>
<p>If two parties are considered: rather than providing their nonce <em>R</em> in the mulitsig protocol, a blinding factor, taken as an elliptic curve point <em>T</em> is conceived and sent in addition to <em>R</em> (ie. <em>R+T</em>). So it can be seen that <em>R</em> is not blinded, it has instead been offset by the secret value <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>Here, the Schnorr mulitsig construction is modified such that the first party generates</p>
<p>$$
T=tG, R=rG
$$</p>
<p>where <em>t</em> is the shared secret, <em>G</em> is the generator of discreet log hard group and <em>r</em> the random nonce</p>
<p>Using this information the second party generates</p>
<p>$$
H(P||R+T||message)x
$$</p>
<p>where the coins to be swapped are contained within <em>message</em>. The first party can now calculate the complete signature <em>s</em> such that</p>
<p>$$
s=r+t+H(P||R+T||message)x
$$</p>
<p>The first party then calculates and publishes the adaptor signature <em>s'</em> to the second party (and any one else listening)</p>
<p>$$
s'=s-t
$$</p>
<p>The second party can verify the adaptor signature <em>s'</em> by asserting <em>s'G</em></p>
<p>$$
s'G =? R+H(P||R+T||message)P
$$</p>
<p>However this is not a valid signature as the hashed nonce point is <em>R+T</em> and not <em>R</em></p>
<p>The second party cannot retrieve a valid signature from this and requires ECDLP solving to recover <em>s'+t</em>, which is virtually impossible.</p>
<p>After the first party broadcasts <em>s</em> to claim the coins within <em>message</em> the second party can calculate the secret <em>t</em> from</p>
<p>$$
t=s-s'
$$</p>
<p>The above is very general however, by attaching auxiliary proofs too one can derive an adaptor signature that will let one translate correct movement of the auxiliary protocol into a valid signature.</p>
<hr />
<a class="header" href="#simultaneous-scriptless-scripts" id="simultaneous-scriptless-scripts"><h2>Simultaneous Scriptless Scripts</h2></a>
<p>The execution of separate transactions in an atomic fashion is achieved through preimages. If two transactions require the preimage to the same hash, once one is executed, the preimage is exposed so that the other one can be too. Atomic Swaps and Lightning channels use this construction. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mVOq1jaR1U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39m20">[4]</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#the-difference" id="the-difference"><h4>The Difference</h4></a>
<p>If we consider the difference of two Schnorr signatures.</p>
<p>$$
d=s-s'=k-k'+ex-e'x'
$$</p>
<p>The above equation can be verified in a similar manner to that of a single Schnorr signature, by multiplying each term by G and confirming algebraic correctness.</p>
<p>$$
dG=kG-k'G+exG-e'x'G
$$</p>
<p>It must be noted that the Schnorr signature itself is not being verified, but instead the difference <em>d</em>. <em>d</em> functions as the translating key between two separate independent Schnorr signatures. Given <em>d</em> and either <em>s</em> or <em>s'</em>, the other can be computed. So possession of <em>d</em> makes these two signatures atomic. This scheme does not link the two signatures or compromise their security.</p>
<p>For an atomic transaction, during the setup stage, someone provides the opposing party with the value <em>d</em>, and asserts it as the correct value. Once the transaction is signed it can be adjusted to complete the other transaction. Atomicity is achieved; but can only be used by the person who possesses this <em>d</em> value. Generally the party that stands to lose money requires the <em>d</em> value.</p>
<p>The <em>d</em> value provides an interesting property with regards to atomicity. It is shared before signatures are public, which in turn allows the two transactions to be atomic once the transactions are published. By taking difference of any two Schnorr signatures one is able to construct transcripts, such as an atomic swap multisig contract.</p>
<p>This is a critical feature for Mimblewimble, which was previously thought to be unable to support atomic swaps or lightning channels. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mVOq1jaR1U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39m20">[4]</a></p>

<a class="header" href="#atomic-cross-chain-swaps-example-with-adaptor-signatures" id="atomic-cross-chain-swaps-example-with-adaptor-signatures"><h2>Atomic (Cross-chain Swaps) Example with Adaptor Signatures</h2></a>
<p>Alice has a certain number of coins on a particular block chain; Bob also has a certain number of coins on another block chain. Alice and Bob want to engage in an atomic exchange, however neither of the block chains are aware of each other nor are they able to verify each others transactions.</p>
<p>The  classical way of achieving this involves the use of the block chain's script system to put a hash preimage challenge and then reveal the same preimage on both sides: Once Alice knows the preimage, she reveals it to take her coins; Bob then copies it of one chain to the other chain to take his coins.</p>
<p>Using adaptor signatures, the same result can be achieved through simpler means. In this case, both Alice and Bob put up their coins on two of two outputs on each block chain. They sign the mulitsig protocols in parallel, where Bob then gives Alice the adaptor signatures for each side using the same value <em>T</em> ; Meaning that for Bob to take his coins he needs to reveal <em>t</em> and for Alice to take her coins she needs to reveal <em>T</em>. Bob then replaces one of the signatures and publishes <em>t</em>, taking his coins. Alice computes <em>t</em>  from the final signature, visible on the block chain and uses that to reveal another signature, giving her her coins.</p>
<p>Thus it can be seen that atomicity is achieved. One is still able to exchange information but now there are no explicit hashes or preimages on the block chain: No script properties are necessary and privacy is achieved. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mVOq1jaR1U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39m20">[4]</a></p>

<p>ZKCP is a transaction protocol. This protocol allows a buyer to purchase information from a seller using coins in a manner which is private, scalable, secure, and importantly in a trustless environment. The expected information is transferred only when  payment is made. The buyer and seller do not need to trust each other or depend on arbitration by a third party.<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/26/zero-knowledge-contingent-payments-announcement/">[6]</a></p>

<a class="header" href="#mimblewimbles-core-scriptless-script" id="mimblewimbles-core-scriptless-script"><h2>Mimblewimble's Core Scriptless Script</h2></a>
<p>As previously stated, Mimblewimble is a block chain design. Built similarly to Bitcoin, every transaction has inputs and outputs. Each input and output has a confidential transaction commitment. Confidential commitments have an interesting property where in a valid balanced transaction one can subtract the input from the output commitments, ensuring that all of the values of the Pedersen values balance out. Taking the difference of these inputs and outputs results in the mulitsig key of the owners of every output and every input in the transaction. This is referred to as the kernel.</p>
<p>Mimblewimble blocks will only have a list of new inputs, a list of new outputs and a list of signatures which are created from the aforementioned excess value. <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-is-mimblewimble/">[7]</a></p>
<p>Since the values are homomorphically encrypted, nodes can verify that no coin are being created or destroyed.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://cryptodigestnews.com/the-logic-of-layer-2-scaling-fe51a8879e13"><u><strong>CryptoDigest</strong></u></a></p>
<p>Layer 2 scaling solutions utilize an interesting approach to scale block chains while keeping them decentralized. Layer 2 solutions are protocols built “on top” of block chains and sacrifice some security in order to potentially match VISA transaction levels. Layer 2 solutions are built with the intention of keeping  the user in control at all times.</p>

<p>In the block chain and cryptocurrency world, transaction processing scaling is a tough problem to solve. This is limited by the average block creation time, the block size limit and number of newer blocks needed to confirm a transaction (confirmation time). These factors make '<em>over the counter</em>' type transactions similar to Master Card or Visa nearly impossible if done on the main block chain (on-chain).</p>
<p><img src="./sources/waiting.png" alt="waiting" /></p>
<p>Let's postulate that block chain and cryptocurrency &quot;takes over the world&quot; and are responsible for all global non-cash transactions performed, i.e. 433.1 billion in 2014-2015 <a href="https://www.worldpaymentsreport.com/download">[25]</a>. This means 13,734 transactions per second (tx/s) on average! <em>(To put this into perspective, VisaNet currently processes 160 billion transactions per year <a href="https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/innovation/contactless-payments-around-the-globe.html">[26]</a> and is capable of handling more than 65,000 transaction messages per second <a href="https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visanet-technology/visa-net-fact-sheet.pdf">[27]</a>.)</em> This means that if all of those were simple single-input-single-output non-cash transactions and performed on...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Segwit enabled Bitcoin 'like' block chains that can theoretically handle ~21.31 tx/s, we would need ~644 parallel versions and with a segwit transaction size of 190 bytes <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/59408/with-100-segwit-transactions-what-would-be-the-max-number-of-transaction-confi">[28]</a> the combined block chain growth would be <em>~210 GB per day</em>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethereum 'like' block chains, and taking current gas prices into account Ethereum can theoretically process ~25.4 tx/s, then ~541 parallel versions would be needed and with a transaction size of 109 bytes (<a href="https://bitsonblocks.net/2016/10/02/a-gentle-introduction-to-ethereum/">[29]</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30175/what-is-the-size-bytes-of-a-simple-ethereum-transaction-versus-a-bitcoin-trans?rq=1">[30]</a>) the combined block chain growth would be <em>~120 GB per day</em>!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why we need a proper scaling solution that would not bloat the block chain.</p>
<p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model defines 7 layers for communication functions of a computing system. Layer 1 refers to the physical layer and Layer 2 to the data link layer. Layer 1 is never concerned with functions of Layer 2 and up, it just delivers transmission and reception of raw data. In turn Layer 2 only knows about Layer 1 and defines the protocols that deliver node-to-node data transfer. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model/">[1]</a></p>

<li>Does every transaction need every parent block chain node in the world to verify it?</li>
<li>Would I be willing to have (temporary) lower security guarantees for most of my day-to-day transactions if I could get them validated (whatever we take that to mean) near-instantly?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can answer 'no' and 'yes', then you're looking for a Layer 2 scaling solution.</p>
<a class="header" href="#how-will-this-be-applicable-to-tari" id="how-will-this-be-applicable-to-tari"><h2>How will this be applicable to Tari?</h2></a>
<p>Tari is a high-throughput protocol that will need to handle real world transaction volumes. For example, Big Neon, the initial business application to be built on top of the Tari block chain requires high volume transactions in a short time, especially when tickets sales open and when tickets will be redeemed at an event. Imagine filling an 85,000 seat stadium with 72 entrance queues on match days. Serialized real world scanning boils down to ~500 tickets in 4 minutes, or ~2 spectators allowed access per second per queue.</p>
<p>This will be impossible to do with parent block chain scaling solutions.</p>

<a class="header" href="#what-is-it" id="what-is-it"><h4>What is it?</h4></a>
<p>A Micropayment Channel is a class of techniques designed to allow users to make multiple Bitcoin transactions without committing all of the transactions to the Bitcoin block chain. In a typical payment channel, only two transactions are added to the block chain but an unlimited or nearly unlimited number of payments can be made between the participants. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment_channels">[11]</a></p>
<p>Several channel designs have been proposed or implemented over the years- these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nakamoto high-frequency transactions</li>
<li>Spillman-style payment channels</li>
<li>CLTV-style payment channels</li>
<li>Poon-Dryja payment channels</li>
<li>Decker-Wattenhofer duplex payment channels</li>
<li>Decker-Russell-Osuntokun eltoo Channels</li>
<li>Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs)</li>
</ul>
<p>With specific focus on Hashed Time-Locked Contracts:
A technique that can allow payments to be securely routed across multiple payment channels. HTlCs are integral to the design of more advanced payment channels such as those used by the <a href="https://gitpitch.com/tari-labs/tari-university/master?p=LightningNetworkForDummies#/">Lightning Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Lightning Network is a second layer payment protocol that operates on top of a block chain. It enables instant transactions between participating nodes. It features a peer-to-peer system for making micro payments of digital cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds and minimising trust of third parties. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network">[12]</a></p>
<p>Normal use of the Lightning Network consists of opening a payment channel by committing a funding transaction to the relevant block chain, followed by making any number of Lightning transactions that update the tentative distribution of the channel's funds without broadcasting to the block chain, optionally followed by closing the payment channel by broadcasting the final version of the transaction to distribute the channel's funds.</p>

<a class="header" href="#what-is-it-1" id="what-is-it-1"><h4>What is it?</h4></a>
<p>State channels are the more general form of micropayment channels — they can be used not only for payments, but for any arbitrary “state update” on a block chain — like changes inside a smart contract. <a href="https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4">[17]</a></p>
<p>State channels allow multiple transactions to be made within off-chain agreements with very fast processing and the final settlement on-chain. It keeps the operation mode of block chain protocol but changes the way it is used so as to deal with the challenge of scalability.</p>
<p>Any change of state within a state channel requires explicit cryptographic consent from all parties designated as “interested” in that part of the state. <a href="https://l4.ventures/papers/statechannels.pdf">[20]</a></p>

<a class="header" href="#what-is-it-3" id="what-is-it-3"><h4>What is it?</h4></a>
<p>A masternode is a server on a decentralized network. It is utilized to complete unique functions in ways ordinary mining nodes cannot, for example features like direct send, instant transactions and private transactions. Because of their increased capabilities, masternodes typically require an investment in order to run. Masternode operators are incentivized and are rewarded by earning portions of block rewards in the cryptocurrency they are facilitating. Masternodes will get the standard return on their stakes, but will also be entitled to a portion of the transaction fees, allowing for a greater ROI. (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-rise-of-masternodes-might-soon-be-followed-by-the-creation-of-servicenodes">[8]</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-rise-of-masternodes-might-soon-be-followed-by-the-creation-of-servicenodes">[10]</a>)</p>
<p><u>Dash Example</u> <a href="https://res.tuoluocaijing.cn/20180517155941-ojog.pdf">[31]</a>
Dash was the first cryptocurrency to implement the masternode model into its protocol. Under what Dash calls its proof of service algorithm, a second tier network of masternodes exists alongside a first tier network of miners to achieve distributed consensus on the block chain. This two tiered system ensures that proof of service and proof of work perform symbiotic maintenance of Dash’s network. Dash masternodes also enable a decentralized governance system that allows node operators to vote on important developments within the block chain. A masternode for Dash requires a stake of 1,000 DASH and share an equally 45% of block rewards with the miners. The other 10% goes to the block chain’s treasury fund, and operators are in charge of voting on proposals for how these funds will be allocated to improve the network.</p>
<p><em>Dash Deterministic Ordering</em></p>
<p>A special deterministic algorithm is used to create a pseudo-random ordering of the masternodes. By using the hash from the proof-of-work for each block, security of this functionality is provided by the mining network.</p>
<p><em>Dash Trustless Quorums</em></p>
<p>The Dash masternode network is trustless where no single entity can control the outcome. N pseudo random masternodes (Quorum A) are selected from the total pool to act as an oracle for N pseudo random masternodes (Quorum B) that are selected to perform the actual task. Quorum A are the closest nodes mathematically to the current block hash, while Quorum B are the furthest. This process is repeated for each new block in the block chain.</p>
<p><em>Dash Proof of Service</em></p>
<p>Bad actors could also run masternodes. To reduce the possibility of bad acting, nodes must ping the rest of the network to ensure they remain active. All masternode verification is done randomly via the Quorum system by the masternode network itself, approximately 1% of the network verified each block. This results in the entire masternode network being verified about six times per day. Six consecutive violations result in the deactivation of a masternode.</p>

<a class="header" href="#what-is-it-4" id="what-is-it-4"><h4>What is it?</h4></a>
<p>Plasma block chains are a chain within a block chain, with state transitions enforced by bonded (time to exit) fraud proofs (block header hashes) submitted on the root chain. It enables management of a tiered block chain without a full persistent record of the ledger on the root block chain and without giving custodial trust to any 3rd party. The fraud proofs enforce an interactive protocol of rapid fund withdrawals in case of foul play like block withholding, in cases where bad actors in a lower level tier want to commit blocks to the root chain without broadcasting it to the higher level tiers. <a href="http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf">[4]</a></p>
<p><img src="./sources/Plasma-example-01.png" alt="Plasma-example-01" /></p>
<p>Plasma is a framework for incentivized and enforced execution of smart contracts, scalable to a significant amount of state updates per second, enabling the root block chain to be able to represent a significant amount of dApps, each employing its own block chain in a tree format. <a href="http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf">[4]</a></p>
<p>Plasma relies on two key parts, namely reframing all block chain computations into a set of MapReduce functions, and an optional method to do Proof-of-Stake token bonding on top of existing block chains (enforced in an on-chain smart contract). Nakamoto Consensus incentives discourage block withholding or other Byzantine behavior. If a chain is Byzantine, it has the option of going to any of its parents (including the root block chain) to continue operation or exit with the current committed state. <a href="http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf">[4]</a></p>
<p><img src="./sources/Plasma-example.png" alt="Plasma example" /></p>
<p>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/16cb30b4b92fd4989b8619a61752a2387c6dd474.pdf">[39]</a> The Plasma MapReduce  includes commitments on data to computation as input in the map phase and includes a merkleized proof of state transition in the reduce step when returning the result.  <a href="http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf">[4]</a></p>

<p>TrueBit is a protocol that provides security and scalability by enabling trustless smart contracts to perform and offloading complex computation. This makes it different from state channels and Plasma, which are more useful for increasing the total transaction throughput of the Ethereum block chain. TrueBit relies on solvers (akin to miners), who have to stake their deposits in a smart contract, solve computation and if correct get their deposit back. If the computation is incorrect, the solver looses their deposit. TrueBit uses an economic mechanism called the “verification game” where an incentive is created for other parties, called <em>challengers,</em> to check the solvers’ work.

<a class="header" href="#what-is-it-6" id="what-is-it-6"><h4>What is it?</h4></a>
<p>The TumbleBit protocol was invented at the Boston University. It is a unidirectional, unlinkable payment hub that is fully compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. TumbleBit allows parties to make fast, anonymous, off-chain payments through an untrusted intermediary called the Tumbler. No-one, not even the Tumbler, can tell which payer paid which payee during a TumbleBit epoch (<em>i.e. time period of significance</em>). Two modes of operation are supported; a classic mixing/tumbling/washing mode or as a fully fledged payment hub. TumbleBit consists of two interleaved fair-exchange protocols - <em>RSA-Puzzle-Solver Protocol</em> and <em>Puzzle-Promise Protocol</em> - that relies on the  Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem's blinding properties to prevent bad acting from either users or Tumblers and to ensure anonymity. TumbleBit also supports anonymizing through Tor to ensure that the Tumbler server can operate as a hidden service. (<a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/heilman/tumblebit/">[1]</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/056.pdf">[8]</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BLWUUPfh2Q&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h3m10s">[9]</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-bitcoin-privacy-scalability-developers-are-making-tumblebit-reality">[10]</a>)</p>
<p><img src="./sources/TumbleBitOverview.PNG" alt="TumbleBitOverview" /></p>
<p>TumbleBit combines off-chain cryptographic computations with standard on-chain Bitcoin scripting functionalities to realize smart contracts (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contract">[11]</a>) that is not dependent on Segwit. The most important Bitcoin functionality used here are hashing conditions, signing conditions, conditional execution, 2-of-2 multi signatures and timelocking. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#who-does-it-5" id="who-does-it-5"><h4>Who does it?</h4></a>
<p>The Boston University provided a proof-of-concept and reference implementation alongside the white paper <a href="https://github.com/BUSEC/TumbleBit">[4]</a>. NTumbleBit <a href="https://github.com/nTumbleBit/nTumbleBit">[5]</a> is being developed as a C# production implementation of the TumbleBit protocol that is currently being deployed by Stratis with their Breeze implementation (<a href="https://stratisplatform.com/2017/07/17/breeze-tumblebit-server-experimental-release">[6]</a>, <a href="https://stratisplatform.com/2017/09/20/breeze-wallet-with-breeze-privacy-protocol-dev-update/">[7]</a>), currently at alpha/experimental release level in testnet.</p>
<p><em>&quot;NTumbleBit will be a cross-platform framework, server and client for the TumbleBit payment scheme. TumbleBit is separated into two modes, tumbler mode and payment hub mode. The tumbler mode improves transaction fungibility and offers risk free unlinkable transactions. Payment hub mode is a way of making off-chain payments possible without requiring implementations like Segwit or the Lightning Network.&quot;</em> <a href="https://medium.com/@Stratisplatform/anonymous-transactions-coming-to-stratis-fced3f5abc2e">[3]</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#strengths-6" id="strengths-6"><h4>Strengths</h4></a>
<p><u>Anonymity properties</u> - TumbleBit provides unlinkability without the need to trust the Tumbler service (i.e. untrusted intermediary). <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<p><u>Denial of Service (DoS) and Sybil protection</u> - &quot;<em>TumbleBit uses transaction fees to resist DoS and Sybil attacks.</em>&quot; <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<p><u>Balance</u> - &quot;<em>The system should not be exploited to print new money or steal money, even when parties collude.</em>&quot;  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<p><u>As a classic tumbler</u> - TumbleBit can also be used as a classic Bitcoin tumbler. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<p><u>Bitcoin compatibility</u> - TumbleBit is fully compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<p><u>Scale ability</u> - Each TumbleBit user only need to interact with the Tumbler and the corresponding transaction party; this lack of coordination between all TumbleBit users makes scale ability possible for the tumbler mode. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<p><u>Batch processing</u> - TumbleBit  supports one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many transactions in payment hub mode. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<p><u>Masternode compatibility</u> - The TumbleBit protocol can be fully implemented as a service in a Masternode. &quot;<em>The Breeze Wallet is now fully capable of providing enhanced privacy to bitcoin transactions through a secure connection. Utilizing Breeze Servers that are pre registered on the network using a secure, trustless registration mechanism that is resistant to manipulation and censorship.</em>&quot; (<a href="https://stratisplatform.com/2017/07/17/breeze-tumblebit-server-experimental-release">[6]</a>, <a href="https://stratisplatform.com/2017/09/20/breeze-wallet-with-breeze-privacy-protocol-dev-update">[7]</a>, <a href="https://stratisplatform.com/2017/08/10/bitcoin-privacy-tumblebit-integrated-into-breeze">[12]</a>)</p>
<p><u>Nearly production ready</u> - The NTumbleBit and Breeze implementations have gained testnet status.</p>
<a class="header" href="#weaknesses-6" id="weaknesses-6"><h4>Weaknesses</h4></a>
<p><u>Privacy not 100% proven</u> - Payees have better privacy than the payers, and theoretically collusion involving payees and the Tumbler can exist to discover the identity of the payer. <a href="https://www.bitcoinmarketinsider.com/tumblebit-wallet-reaches-one-step-forward">[13]</a></p>
<p><u>Tumbler service not distributed</u> - More work needs to be done to ensure persistent transaction state in case a Tumbler server goes down.</p>
<p><u>Equal denominations required</u> - The TumbleBit protocol can only support a common denominator unit value. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf">[2]</a></p>

<a class="header" href="#what-is-it-7" id="what-is-it-7"><h4>What is it?</h4></a>
<p>Counterparty is NOT a block chain. Counterparty is a token protocol released in January 2014 that operates on Bitcoin. It has a fully functional Decentralized Exchange (DEX), as well as several hardcoded smart contracts defined that include contracts for difference and binary options (&quot;bets&quot;). To operate, Counterparty utilizes &quot;embedded consensus&quot;, which means that a Counterparty transaction is created and embedded into a Bitcoin transaction, using encoding such as 1-of-3 multi-signature (multisig), Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) or Pay To Public Key Hash (P2PKH). Counterparty nodes, i.e. nodes that run both <code>bitcoind</code> and the <code>counterparty-server</code> applications, will receive Bitcoin transactions as normal (from <code>bitcoind</code>), and then <code>counterparty-server</code> will scan each, and decode and parse any embedded Counterparty transactions it finds. In effect, Counterparty is a ledger within the larger Bitcoin ledger, and the functioning of embedded consensus can be thought of similar to the fitting of one Russian stacking doll inside another.  <a href="https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Documentation/blob/master/Basics/FAQ-SmartContracts.md">([30]</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@droplister/counterparty-development-101-2f4d9b0c8df3">[31]</a>, <a href="https://counterparty.io">[32]</a>)</p>
<p>Embedded consensus also means that the nodes maintain identical ledgers without using a separate peer-to-peer network, solely using the Bitcoin block chain for all communication (i.e. timestamping, transaction ordering and transaction propagation). Unlike Bitcoin, which has the concept of both a soft fork and a hard fork, a change to the protocol or &quot;consensus&quot; code of Counterparty always has the potential to create a hard fork. In practice, this means that each Counterparty node must run the same version of <code>counterparty-server</code> (or at least the same minor version, e.g. the &quot;3&quot; in 2.3.0) so that the protocol code matches up across all nodes. (<a href="https://counterparty.io/docs/faq/">[56]</a>, <a href="https://counterparty.io/docs/protocol_specification/">[57]</a>)</p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin's UTXO model, the Counterparty token protocol utilizes an accounts system where each Bitcoin address is an account, and Counterparty credit and debit transactions for a specific token type affect account balances of that token for that given address. The decentralized exchange allows for low-friction exchanging of different tokens between addresses, utilizing the concept of &quot;orders&quot;, which are individual transactions made by Counterparty clients, and &quot;order matches&quot;, which the Counterparty protocol itself will generate as it parses new orders which overlap existing active orders in the system. It is the Counterparty protocol code itself which manages the escrow of tokens when an order is created, the exchange of tokens between two addresses that have overlapping orders, and the release of those assets from escrow post-exchange.</p>
<p>Counterparty uses its own token, XCP, which was created through a &quot;proof of burn&quot;  process during January 2014 <a href="https://counterparty.io/news/why-proof-of-burn/">[58]</a>. In that month, over 2,000 bitcoins were destroyed by various individuals sending them to an unspendable address on the Bitcoin network (<code>1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr</code>), which caused the Counterparty protocol to award the sending address with a corresponding amount of XCP. XCP is used for payment of asset creation fees, collateral for contracts for difference/binary options, and often used as a base token in decentralized exchange transactions (largely due to the complexities of using BTC in such trades).</p>
<p><img src="./sources/CounterpartyStack.png" alt="CounterpartyStack" /></p>
<p>Support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was implemented, but never included on the mainnet version (<a href="https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Documentation/blob/master/Basics/FAQ-SmartContracts.md">[30]</a>. With the Counterparty EVM implementation, all published Counterparty smart contracts “live” at Bitcoin addresses that start with a <code>C</code>. Counterparty is used to broadcast an <code>execute</code> transaction to call a specific function or method in the smart contract code. Once an execution transaction is confirmed by a Bitcoin miner, the Counterparty federated nodes will receive the request and execute that method. The contract state is modified as the smart contract code executes and stored in the Counterparty database. <a href="https://counterparty.io/docs/faq/">[56]</a></p>
<p>General consensus has it that a <em>federated network</em> is a <em>distributed network of centralized networks</em>. The Ripple blockchain implements a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism. Federated sidechains implements a security protocol using a trusted federation of mutually distrusting functionaries/notaries. Counterparty utilizes a &quot;full stack&quot; packaging system for its components and all dependencies called the &quot;federated node&quot; system,  but this meaning refers to federated in the general definition (i.e. &quot;set up as a single centralized unit within which each state or division keeps some internal autonomy&quot;). (<a href="http://networkcultures.org/unlikeus/resources/articles/what-is-a-federated-network">[54]</a>, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/federated-byzantine-agreement-24ec57bf36e0">[55]</a>, <a href="https://blockstream.com/technology/sidechains.pdf">[28]</a>)</p>
<a class="header" href="#who-uses-it" id="who-uses-it"><h4>Who uses it?</h4></a>

<p>COVAL is being developed with a primary purpose of moving value using “off-chain” methods. They use their own set of node runners to manage various &quot;off-chain&quot; distributed ledgers and ledger assigned wallets to implement an extended transaction value system, whereby tokens as well as containers of tokens can be securely transacted. Scaling within the COVAL eco system is thus achievable because they are not only reliant on the Counterparty federated nodes to execute smart contracts. <a href="https://coval.readme.io/docs">[33]</a></p>

<p>A 2-way peg (2WP) allows the &quot;transfer&quot; of BTC from the main Bitcoin block chain to a secondary block chain and vice-versa at a fixed rate by making use of an appropriate security protocol. The &quot;transfer&quot; actually involves BTC to be locked on the main Bitcoin block chain and unlocked/made available on the secondary block chain. The 2WP promise is concluded when an equivalent amount of tokens on the secondary block chain are locked (in the secondary block chain) so that the original bitcoins can be unlocked.

<p>The locking of BTC on the main Bitcoin block chain is done by using a P2SH transaction where BTC can be sent to a script hash instead of a public key hash.

<p>Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP) is a technique for transaction compression that allows processing a higher volume of transactions but storing much less information. The Lumino network is a lightning-like extension of the RSK platform that uses LTCP. Delta (difference) compression of selected fields of transactions from the same owner are done by using aggregate signing of previous transactions so previous signatures can be disposed. <a href="https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/ec5278f8-218c-407a-af3c-ab71a910246d/LuminoTransactionCompressionProtocolLTCP.pdf">[17]</a></p>
<p>Each transaction contains a set of persistent fields called the Persistent Transaction Information (PTI) and a compound record of user transaction data called the SigRec. A Lumino block stores two Merkle trees - one containing all PTIs and the other all transaction IDs (hash of the signed SigRec). This second Merkle tree is conceptually similar to the Segwit witness tree, thus forming the witness part. Docking is the process where SicRec and signature data can be pruned from the block chain if valid linked PTI information exist. <a href="https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/ec5278f8-218c-407a-af3c-ab71a910246d/LuminoTransactionCompressionProtocolLTCP.pdf">[17]</a></p>

<p><em>Scriptless Scripts</em> was coined and invented by mathematician Andrew Poelstra whereby scripting functionality is offered without actual scripts on the block chain to implement smart contracts. Currently it can only work on the Mimblewimble block chain and makes use of a specific Schnorr signature scheme <a href="https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki">[38]</a> that allows for signature aggregation, mathematically combining several signatures into a single signature, without having to prove Knowledge of Secret Keys (KOSK). This is known as the <em>plain public-key model</em> where the only requirement is that each potential signer has a public key. The KOSK scheme requires that users prove knowledge (or possession) of the secret key during public key registration with a certification authority, and is one way to generically prevent rogue-key attacks. (<a href="https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html">[35]</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068.pdf">[36]</a>)</p>
<p>Signature aggregation properties sought here are (<a href="https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html">[35]</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068.pdf">[36]</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be provably secure in the <em>plain public-key model</em>;</li>
<li>Must satisfy the normal Schnorr equation, whereby the resulting signature can be written as a function of a combination of the public keys;</li>
<li>Must allow for Interactive Aggregate Signatures (IAS) where the signers are required to cooperate;</li>
<li>Must allow for Non-interactive Aggregate Signatures (NAS) where the aggregation can be done by anyone;</li>
<li>Must allow each signer to sign the same message;</li>
<li>Must allow each signer to sign their own message.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is different to a normal multi-signature scheme where one message is signed by all.</p>
<p>Let's say Alice and Bob each needs to provide half a Schnorr signature for a transaction whereby Alice promises to reveal a secret to Bob in exchange for 1 crypto coin. Alice can calculate the difference between her half Schnorr signature and the Schnorr signature of the secret (adaptor signature) and hand it over to Bob. Bob then has the ability to verify the correctness of the adaptor signature without knowing the original signatures. Bob can then provide his half Schnorr signature to Alice so she can broadcast the full Schnorr signature to claim the crypto coin. By broadcasting the full Schnorr signature Bob has access to Alice's half Schnorr signature and he can then calculate the Schnorr signature of the secret because he already knows the adaptor signature, thereby claiming his prize. This is also known as Zero-Knowledge Contingent payments.

<p>In a recent work Maxwell et al. (<a href="https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html">[35]</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068.pdf">[36]</a>) showed that a naive implementation of Schnorr multi-signatures that satisfies key aggregation is not secure, and that the Bellare and Neven (BN) Schnorr signature scheme loses the key aggregation property in order to gain security in the plain public-key model. They proposed a new Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme with key aggregation called MuSig, which is provably secure in the <em>plain public-key model</em>. It has the same key and signature size as standard Schnorr signatures. The joint signature can be verified exactly the same as a standard Schnorr signature with respect to a single “aggregated” public-key, which can be computed from the individual public keys of the signers. Note that the case of interactive signature aggregation where each signer signs their own message must still be proven by a complete security analysis.</p>
<a class="header" href="#opportunities-for-tari-10" id="opportunities-for-tari-10"><h4>Opportunities for Tari</h4></a>
<p>Tari plans to implement the Mimblewimble block chain and should implement the <em>Scriptless Script</em>s together with the MuSig Schnorr signature scheme.</p>
<p>However, this in itself will not provide the Layer 2 scaling performance that will be required. Big Neon, the initial business application to be built on top of the Tari block chain, requires to &quot;facilitate 500 tickets in 4 minutes&quot;, that is ~2 spectators allowed access every second, with negligible latency.</p>
<p>The Mimblewimble <em>Scriptless Script</em>s could be combined with a federated node (or specialized masternode), similar to that being developed by Counterparty. The secrets that are revealed by virtue of the MuSig Schnorr signatures can instantiate normal smart contracts inside the federated node, with the final consolidated state update being written back to the block chain after the event.</p>

<p>In mathematics and computer science, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles. A directed graph is acyclic if and only if it has a topological ordering, that is for every directed edge <em>uv</em> from vertex <em>u</em> to vertex <em>v</em>, <em>u</em> comes before <em>v</em> in the ordering (age). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">[42]</a></p>
<p><img src="./sources/DAG.PNG" alt="DAG" /></p>
<p>DAGs in block chain were first proposed as the GHOST protocol (<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf">[44]</a>, <a href="http://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/paper_101.pdf">[45]</a>), a version of which is implemented in Ethereum as the Ethash PoW algorithm (based on Dagger-Hashimoto). Then Braiding (<a href="https://scalingbitcoin.org/hongkong2015/presentations/DAY2/2_breaking_the_chain_1_mcelrath.pdf">[40]</a>,  <a href="https://rawgit.com/mcelrath/braidcoin/master/Braid%2BExamples.html">[41]</a>), Jute <a href="https://scalingbitcoin.org/milan2016/presentations/D2%20-%209%20-%20David%20Vorick.pdf">[43]</a>, SPECTRE <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/%7Eyoni_sompo/pubs/16/SPECTRE_complete.pdf">[46]</a> and PHANTOM <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/242600_92372943016c47ecb2e94b2fc07876d6.pdf">[52]</a> was presented. The principle of DAG in block chain is to present a way to include traditional off-chain blocks into the ledger, which is governed by mathematical rules. A parent that is simultaneously an ancestor of another parent is disallowed</p>
<p><img src="./sources/DAGTopologicalOrdering.PNG" alt="DAGTopologicalOrdering" /></p>
<p>The main problems to be solved by the DAG derivative protocols are <strong>(a)</strong> inclusion of orphaned blocks (decrease the negative effect of slow propagation) and <strong>(b)</strong> mitigation against selfish mining attacks. The underlying concept is still in the research and exploration phase. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/if-there-is-an-answer-to-selfish-mining-braiding-could-be-it-1482876153">[39]</a></p>
<p><img src="./sources/GHOST.PNG" alt="GHOST" /></p>
<p>In most DAG derivative protocols, blocks containing conflicting transactions (<em>i.e. conflicting blocks</em>) are not orphaned. A subsequent block is built on top of both of the conflicting blocks, but the conflicting transactions themselves are thrown out while processing the chain. SPECTRE, for one, provides a scheme whereby blocks vote to decide which transactions are robustly accepted, robustly rejected or stay in an indefinite “pending” state in case of conflicts. Both conflicting blocks become part of the shared history, and both conflicting blocks earn their respective miners a block reward. (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/if-there-is-an-answer-to-selfish-mining-braiding-could-be-it-1482876153">[39]</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@avivzohar/the-spectre-protocol-7dbbebb707b5">[50]</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1159.pdf">[51]</a>)</p>
<p><em><u>Note:</u> Braiding requires that parents and siblings may not contain conflicting transactions.</em></p>
<p><img src="./sources/SPECTRE.PNG" alt="SPECTRE" /></p>
<p>Inclusive (DAG derivative) protocols that integrate the contents of traditional off-chain blocks into the ledger results in incentives for behavior changes by the nodes that lead to an increased throughput, and a better payoff for weak miners. <a href="http://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/paper_101.pdf">[45]</a></p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification"><u><strong>Bitcoin Wiki</strong></u></a></p>
<p>Merged mining is the act of using work done on another block chain (the Parent) on one or more Auxiliary block chains and to accept it as valid on its own chain, using Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW), which is the relationship between two block chains for one to trust the other's work as their own. The Parent block chain does not need to be aware of the AuxPoW logic as blocks submitted to it are still valid blocks.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/what-is-merged-mining-bitcoin-namecoin-litecoin-dogecoin/"><u><strong>CryptoCompare</strong></u></a></p>
<p>Merged mining is the process of allowing two different crypto currencies based on the same algorithm to be mined simultaneously. This allows low hash powered crypto currencies to increase the hashing power behind their network by bootstrapping onto more popular crypto currencies.</p>
<a class="header" href="#merged-mining-introduction" id="merged-mining-introduction"><h1>Merged Mining Introduction</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#what-is-merged-mining" id="what-is-merged-mining"><h2>What is merged mining?</h2></a>
<p>Merged mining is the act of using work done on another block chain (the Parent) on one or more Auxiliary block chains and to accept it as valid on its own chain, using Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW), which is the relationship between two block chains for one to trust the other's work as their own. The Parent block chain does not need to be aware of the AuxPoW logic as blocks submitted to it are still valid blocks. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification">[1]</a></p>
<p>As an example the structure of merged mined blocks in Namecoin and Bitcoin is shown below. <a href="http://repositum.tuwien.ac.at/obvutwhs/download/pdf/2315652">[25]</a></p>
<p><img src="./sources/MergedMiningIntro01.png" alt="MergedMiningIntro01" /></p>
<p>A transaction set for both block chains are assembled. The hash of the AuxPoW block header is then inserted in the 'free' bytes region (coinbase field) of the coinbase transaction and submitted to the Parent block chain's Proof-of-Work (PoW). If the merge miner solves the block at the difficulty level of either or both block chains the respective block(s) are re-assembled with the completed PoW and submitted to the correct block chain. In case of the Auxiliary block chain the Parent's block hash, Merkle tree branch and coinbase transaction are inserted in the Auxiliary block's AuxPoW header. This is to prove that enough work was done on the Parent block chain that meets the difficulty level of the Auxiliary block chain. (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification">[1]</a>, <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/273/how-does-merged-mining-work">[2]</a>, <a href="http://repositum.tuwien.ac.at/obvutwhs/download/pdf/2315652">[25]</a>)</p>
<p>The propagation of Parent and Auxiliary blocks are totally independent and only governed by each chain's difficulty level. As an example the diagram below shows how this can play out in practice with Namecoin and Bitcoin when the Parent difficulty (D<sub>BTC</sub>) is larger than the Auxiliary difficulty (D<sub>NMC</sub>) . Note that <em>BTC block 2'</em> did not become part of the Parent block chain propagation.</p>

<a class="header" href="#merged-mining-with-multiple-auxiliary-chains" id="merged-mining-with-multiple-auxiliary-chains"><h2>Merged mining with multiple Auxiliary chains</h2></a>
<p>A miner can use a single Parent to perform merged mining on multiple Auxiliary block chains. The Merkle tree root of a Merkle tree that contains the block hashes of the Auxiliary blocks as leaves must then be inserted in the Parent's coinbase field as shown below. To prevent double spending attacks each Auxiliary block chain must specify a unique ID that can be used to derive the leave of the Merkle tree where the respective block hash must be located. <a href="http://repositum.tuwien.ac.at/obvutwhs/download/pdf/2315652">[25]</a></p>

<li>The Auxiliary block chain's target block times can be smaller, equal or larger than the Parent block chain.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a class="header" href="#a51-attacks" id="a51-attacks"><h3>51% attacks</h3></a>
<ul>
<li>51% attacks are real and relevant today. Bitcoin Gold (rank #28 @ 2018/05/29) and Verge (rank #33 @ 2018/05/29) suffered recent attacks with double spend transactions following. (<a href="https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-gold-hit-by-double-spend-attack-exchanges-lose-millions">[11]</a>, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/privacy-coin-verge-succumbs-to-51-attack-again">[12]</a>)</li>
<li>In a conservative analysis, successful attacks on PoW cryptocurrencies are more likely when dishonest entities control more than 25% of the total mining power. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/791.pdf">[24]</a></li>
<li>Tari tokens are envisaged to be merged mined with Monero <a href="https://www.tari.com">[13]</a>, as such the Monero block chain security is important to the Tari block chain.</li>
<li>Monero recently (2018-04-06) introduced a hard fork with upgraded PoW algorithm CryptoNight v7 at block height 1546000 to maintain their Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) resistance and hence guard against 51% attacks. The Monero team proposes changes to their PoW every scheduled fork (i.e. every 6 months) going forward. (<a href="https://www.ccn.com/monero-hard-forks-to-maintain-asic-resistance-but-classic-hopes-to-spoil-the-party">[14]</a>, <a href="https://getmonero.org/2018/02/11/pow-change-and-key-reuse.html">[15]</a>)</li>
<li>An interesting question arises what needs to happen to the Tari block chain if the Monero block chain is hard forked. Since the CryptoNight v7 hard fork the network hash rate for Monero hovers around ~500 MH/s, whereas in the two months immediately prior it was ~1,000 MH/s <a href="https://chainradar.com/xmr/chart">[20]</a>. Thus 50% of the hash power can be ascribed to ASICS and botnet miners.</li>
<li><img src="./sources/MoneroHashRate.png" alt="MoneroHashRate" /></li>
<li>NiceHash statistics for CryptoNight v7 <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/algorithm/cryptonightv7">[21]</a> shows a lag of 2 days for ~ 100,600 miners to get up to speed with providing the new hashing power after the Monero hard fork.</li>
<li><img src="./sources/CryptoNight-v7.png" alt="CryptoNight-v7" /></li>
<li>The Tari block chain will have to fork together with or just after a scheduled Monero fork. The Tari block chain will be vulnerable to ASIC miners until it has been forked.</li>

<li>A miner could cheat the PoW system by putting more than one Auxiliary block header into one Parent block <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Alternative_chain#Protecting_against_double_proof">[7]</a>.</li>
<li>Multiple Auxiliary blocks can be competing for the same PoW, and could subject your Auxiliary block chain to nothing-at-stake attacks if the chain is forked, maliciously or by accident, with consequent attempts to reverse transactions.

<li>Litecoin has experienced slight centralisation since mid-2014, among others caused by Clevermining and F2Pool.</li>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token"><u><strong>Wikipedia</strong></u></a></p>
<p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens that are fungible in nature. NFTs are used to create verifiable digital scarcity, for example in several specific applications that require unique digital items like crypto-collectibles and crypto-gaming.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://btcmanager.com/non-fungible-tokens/"><u><strong>BTC Manager</strong></u></a></p>
<p>A non-fungible tokens (NFT) are blockchain tokens that are designed to be wholly and distinguishable from each other. Using unique metadata, avatars, individual token IDs, and custody chains, NFTs are created to ensure that no two NFT tokens are identical. This is because they exist to store information rather than value, unlike their fungible counterparts.</p>

<a class="header" href="#block-chain-related-protocols" id="block-chain-related-protocols"><h1>Block Chain Related Protocols</h1></a>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain"><u><strong>Wikipedia - 1</strong></u></a></p>
<p>A block chain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash).</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol"><u><strong>Wikipedia - 2</strong></u></a></p>
<p>A security protocol (cryptographic protocol or encryption protocol) is an abstract or concrete protocol that performs a security-related function and applies cryptographic methods, often as sequences of cryptographic primitives. A protocol describes how the algorithms should be used. A sufficiently detailed protocol includes details about data structures and representations, at which point it can be used to implement multiple, interoperable versions of a program.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://medium.com/market-protocol/blockchain-crash-course-protocols-dapps-apis-and-dexs-4c324964f9c2"><u><strong>Market Protocol</strong></u></a></p>
<p>A protocol can be seen as a methodology agreed upon by two or more parties that establish a common set of rules that they can agree upon so as to enter into a binding agreement. Protocols are therefore the set of rules that govern the network. Block chain protocols usually include rules about consensus, transaction validation, and network participation.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/protocol-computer-science"><u><strong>Encyclopaedia Britannica</strong></u></a></p>
<p>Protocol, in computer science, is a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it. Without a protocol, a transmitting computer, for example, could be sending its data in 8-bit packets while the receiving computer might expect the data in 16-bit packets.</p>

<a class="header" href="#what-are-atomic-swaps" id="what-are-atomic-swaps"><h2>What are Atomic swaps</h2></a>
<p>Atomic swaps or cross-chain atomic swaps <a href="https://coinsutra.com/atomic-swap/">[1]</a> in a nutshell are decentralized exchanges, but only for cryptocurrencies. This allows multiple parties to exchange two different crypto currencies in a trustless environment. If one party defaults or fails the transaction, neither party can &quot;run off&quot; with the anyone's money.  For this to work, we will require two technologies: a payment channel and hashed timelock contracts. An implementation of a payment channel is the lightning network.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hashed-timelock-contracts" id="hashed-timelock-contracts"><h2>Hashed Timelock Contracts</h2></a>
<p>Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-are-hashed-timelock-contracts-htlcs-application-in-lightning-network-payment-channels-14437eeb9345">[2]</a> is one of the most important technologies required for atomic swaps. This is a payment class that uses hashlocks and timelocks to require certain public knowledge before doing a payment, otherwise the payment is reversed. HTLCs are also crucial in the lighting network <a href="https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a quick example of how a HTLC works:</p>
<p><img src="sources/Characters.png" alt="alt" /></p>
<p>In this example Alex's wants to pay Carla, but he does not have an open payment channel to Carla. But he does have an open channel to Bart who does have an open channel to Carla.</p>
<ol>
<li>Carla generates a random number and gives the hash of the number to Alex.</li>
<li>Alex pays Bart but adds the condition that if Bart wants to claim the payment he has to provide the random number that generated the hash Carlo gave to Alex.</li>
<li>Bart pays Carlo, but he adds the same condition to the payment.</li>
<li>Carla claims the payment by providing the random number, and thus exposing the random number to Bart.</li>
<li>Bart uses the random number to claim the payment from Alex.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the payment to Carla does not go through the timelock in the contract will reverse all transactions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#atomic-vs-etomic" id="atomic-vs-etomic"><h2>Atomic vs Etomic</h2></a>
<p>For an atomic swap transaction to happen, both cryptocurrencies must use the same hashing function as this is crucial for HTLC to function. Etomic swaps was created in an attempt to make atomic swaps happen between Bitcoin tokens and Ethereum based tokens.</p>
<a class="header" href="#examples-of-current-atomic-swaps-and-implementations" id="examples-of-current-atomic-swaps-and-implementations"><h2>Examples of current atomic swaps and implementations</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#a1-manual-method" id="a1-manual-method"><h3>#1 Manual method</h3></a>
<p>An article was posted on Hackernoon <a href="https://hackernoon.com/so-how-do-i-really-do-an-atomic-swap-f797852c7639">[3]</a> showing the exact steps that is required for doing an atomic swap using cli.</p>
<p>The requirements for this method can be listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full nodes on both parties.</li>
<li>Atomic swap package [[4].</li>
<li>Use of supported coins (UXTO based protocol coins, eg Bitcoin, Litecoin, Viacoin).</li>
<li>Power user.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#a2-atomic-wallet" id="a2-atomic-wallet"><h3>#2 Atomic Wallet</h3></a>
<p>Atomic wallet <a href="https://atomicwallet.io/">[5]</a> is an atomic swap exchange. They allow two parties to trade with them as a third party.  The process looks as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Party A select an order from the BitTorrent order book.</li>
<li>Party A enter an amount of coin to swap or coin to receive.</li>
<li>Party A confirm the swap.</li>
<li>Party B receives notification.</li>
<li>Party B confirms the swap.</li>
<li>First party and Second party’s Atomic Wallet checks the contracts.</li>
<li>Both receive their coins.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#a3-barterdex" id="a3-barterdex"><h3>#3 BarterDEX</h3></a>
<p>BarterDEX is a decentralized exchange created by Komodo <a href="https://komodoplatform.com/decentralized-exchange/">[6]</a> but it works with electron servers or native. BarterDEX at its core is more like an auction system then a true decentralized exchange. It also uses a security deposit in the form of Zcredits to do swaps without waiting for confirmation.</p>
<p>BarterDEX also supports Etomic swaps. These work by keeping the payments locked in a etomic blockchain which will act as a third party. Although swaps have been done, it is stated as not yet production ready <a href="https://github.com/artemii235/etomic-swap">[7]</a>. Currently (July 2018) its only possible to use Barterdex out of the  cli <a href="%22https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/Installing-and-Using-Komodo-Platform-(barterDEX)%22">[8]</a>.  Barterdex charges a 0.1287% fee for a swap <a href="https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/barterDEX-Whitepaper-v2">[9]</a>.</p>
